# [00_how_to_docker] EXERCISE 28
# by AIDAN LIM (@DLIM)
#
# SUBJECT
#
# ... Damn it, a group of zergs is attacking orbital-command, 
# and shutting down the engineering-bay service won’t help at all... 
# You must send a troup of Marines to eliminate the intruders. 
# Launch a 42school/marine-squad in two replicas, 
# and make sure that the service works properly 
# (see the documentation provided at hub.docker.com). 
# This service will be named... marines and will be on the overmind network.
#
# ANSWER

docker service create -d --name marines --network overmind --replicas 2 -e OC_USERNAME=root -e OC_PASSWD=root 42school/marine-squad
